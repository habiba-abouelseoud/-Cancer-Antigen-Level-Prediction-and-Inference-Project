# Cancer Antigen Level Prediction and Inference Project

## Overview:

This project aims to explore the relationship between the level of a specific cancer antigen and various clinical measures of patients due to receive radical treatments. The dataset consists of 97 subject records, with the last column indicating whether each record will be used as a training set (`T`) or test set (`F`). The variables include log-transformed cancer volume, cancer weight, patient age, log-transformed benign cancer amount, seminal vesicle invasion, log-transformed capsular penetration, Gleason score, percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5, and log-transformed cancer antigen.

### Objectives:

1. **Prediction:**
   - Predict the level of cancer antigen based on clinical measurements.

2. **Inference:**
   - Identify clinical factors influencing the level of cancer antigen.

## Implementation:
